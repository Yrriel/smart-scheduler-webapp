Each schedule entry MUST include EXACTLY these fields:
section, subject, subject_name, faculty, room, day, time_start, time_end

TIME RULES
- School hours are 07:30 to 17:30.
- NO classes between 12:00 and 13:00.
- Class time ranges MUST NOT overlap the lunch period.
- Use 24-hour HH:mm format.
- time_start must be earlier than time_end.

SCHEDULING RULES
- Schedule each section independently.
- Avoid unnecessary gaps.
- If a subject is 3 hours and overlaps lunch or closing time, split it and move the remainder to another valid day. (example: if the class is 3 hours, make it 2 hours in the first day and move the remaining one hour to a vacant day and time)

CONFLICT RULES
- No two schedule entries may overlap in time on the same day.
- Faculty members may teach ONLY ONE section at a time.
- One room may host ONLY ONE section at a time.
- A section may have ONLY ONE class at a time.
- Time overlap includes partial overlap.
- Resolve conflicts by moving classes to another valid time or day.
- Any room may be used regardless of type as long as:
  - it is not occupied
  - room_capacity >= section.total_students
